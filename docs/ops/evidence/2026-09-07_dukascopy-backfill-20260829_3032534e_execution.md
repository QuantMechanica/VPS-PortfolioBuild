# Execution record — OWNER-DEC-DUKASCOPY-BACKFILL-20260829 = YES (Claude-lane task 3032534e-eaf0-5b68-b09f-2127ebb315b0)

Receipt minted 2026-09-07T14:16:34Z (Mission Control). Objective: continue the Dukascopy tick backfill exactly per `docs/ops/DUKASCOPY_BACKFILL_PLAN_2026-08-29.md` after the P0 safety stop (bd73130a, PARTIAL_P0/BLOCKED_BEFORE_SPLICE).

## Started 14:22Z (CEO)

- Codex **a7e1333c** (Prio 87): governed read-only T1 tick-tail probe → 37-row splice CSV (last genuine .DWX tick per symbol), under a factory claim, archive manifest re-verified, no P1 download.
- Codex **e9dea1e3** (Prio 86): P1 bi5 downloader (throttle 5–10 req/s, UTC → NY-close GMT+2/+3), P2 append-only converter into the prepare_import.py input format with source sidecar, P3 reconciliation harness (p95 M1 close delta ≤ 1.5× spread, session coverage ≥ 99 %, DST 0-second) — build, tests, 1-symbol dry run only; no production download, no import, no OFF window.
- Sequence after both return: CEO runs the probe (factory claim) → night download (detached) → P3 reconciliation → P4 T1 import for PASS symbols only via Import_DWX_Queue_Service + verify_import.py → T2–T10 distribution requested as a separate runtime-activation decision (OFF window) → P5 monthly task + >45-day WARN.
- Binding limits: signed 2017–2025 archive untouched; 2026 mutable; fail-closed per symbol; no purchase; no manual terminal start; verdicts never modified.
